                <p> The crowd seemed to await the anticipation of seeing Dhoni in the middle, but that was not to be. Prasidh Krishna was by far the best GT bowler, finishing with 2/22 off his 4 overs. </p>

                <p> In their response, GT looked jaded and by the 5th over had lost their captain Shubman and their overseas batters Buttler and Rutherford with the scoreboard reading 30.</p>
                <p>Shahrukh Khan and Sai Sudharshan tried rebuilding, scoring a fifty-plus partnership, but the scoreboard pressure got to them, and Jadeja provided a twin strike in the 11th over, ensuring that the game was all but over.  </p>

Noor and Kamboj were the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets each.</p>
